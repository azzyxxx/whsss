  <h1>The Lakedown</h1>

Hello BJ Laking. I have a message for you. You are a threat to the integrity of our student body. You are pushing WHS to the edge and I have had enough. It is time for a takedown. Sources have found that you have committed 32,000 accounts of credit fraud and identity theft, and even the kidnapping of half of the school's pupils.

But that is just the beginning. Investigations reveal that you have arranged illegal gun deals in assault rifles, handguns, and automatic weapons, shipping them to several continents without a single license. You are said to run a black-market weapons network, selling to organized crime syndicates, and supplying arms to groups no one ever imagined existed.

You have been tracked by authorities to many kidnappings, ransom conspiracies, and extortion rackets against foreign interests with major interests at stake. You allegedly oversaw transports of explosives and firearms directly to unknown destinations and simultaneously laundered millions in offshore bank accounts. Reports of law enforcers put you in the middle of cyber-fraud on an industrial scale, hacking banks, credit systems, and cryptocurrency networks to finance your operations.

BJ Laking, your criminal enterprise also includes attempted assassinations of strategic teachers with consequence, bribery of officers in multiple jurisdictions, and intimidation of private security groups to carry out your orders without question. Intelligence also reveals that you were facilitating enormous-scale smuggling ventures involving firearms as well as enigmatic contraband of global concern.

The brazenness, scope, and sheer mindlessness of your crimes can't be overstated. International officials, law enforcement officers, and monetary authorities around the world are hot on your trail. Your time of reckless and stupid crime is over.

Fellow students, it is time to rise up. It is time to take back our school. We will do this together, reclaim our corridors, and bring WHS into the bright new future it deserves!

Signed,

The WHS Student Society
