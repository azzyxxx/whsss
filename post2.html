We are the true voice of the students, and we’re ready to take action. With unwavering determination, we’ll march forward. Our message will echo from the rooftops, resonate through the hallways, fill every classroom, and reach even the farthest corners of the cafeteria. Nothing can hold us back. We’ll move mountains, shift the stars, and rewrite the rules if we have to. Our resolve is unbreakable, and our spirit is wild and free. We are the true force, the real power, the heartbeat of this school. And we’ll keep doing what needs to be done, again and again, louder and stronger, until everyone hears us and understands that we won’t be overlooked. Signed,

The WHS Student Society
